#+TITLE: Stipje, like XPM images, but C++-style
#+AUTHOR: Chris Smeele

Stipje reads XPM-style image strings and converts them to 32-bit pixel buffers
at compile-time.

Several image formats are included as well, to (at runtime) output images in
PNM, PAM or true-color console block drawing characters. Other formatters can
be trivially added.

** Synopsis

Requirements:

- GCC 8 for experimental c++2a support
- Draken for metaprogramming assistance

*NOTE*: This branch, which uses Draken instead of Kvasir MPL, may OOM gcc
during compilation when using large pictures (the lena example is commented out
for this reason). Besides that, this version is functionally identical to the
Kvasir MPL version on the master branch.
